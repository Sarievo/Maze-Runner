# Maze_Runner
<h4>A program that generates mazes and looks for a way out. </h4>
Mazes are amazing: keep running, find the exit if you can! <br>
If you are not too happy about getting stuck in the actual maze, <br>
you can entertain yourself with a virtual one. <br>

Generate a maze (use a odd number to set maze scale)<br>
